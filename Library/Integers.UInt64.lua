--- UInt64 represents a 64 bit unsigned integer, similar to Int64.
--- @class UInt64
UInt64 = {}

--- Decodes an 8-byte Lua binary string, using given endianness, into a new UInt64 object.
--- @param string string The Lua string containing a binary 64-bit integer.
--- @param endian? boolean  If set to true then little-endian is used, if false then big-endian; if missing or nil, native host endian.
--- @return UInt64 @The UInt64 object created, or nil on failure.
function UInt64.decode(string, endian) end

--- Creates a UInt64 Object.
--- @param value? number  A number, UInt64, Int64, or string of digits to assign the value of the new UInt64. Default is 0.
--- @param highvalue? number  If this is a number and the first argument was a number, then the first will be treated as a lower 32 bits, and this is the high-order 32-bit number.
--- @return UInt64 @The new UInt64 object.
function UInt64.new(value, highvalue) end

--- Creates a UInt64 of the maximum possible value. In other words, this should return an UInt64 object of the number 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.
